                Hi all! Found out about aviator 2 months ago, accidentally saw an advertisement on instagram. I was surprised that young guys make 100k rupees a month. Wanted to try, started with 1000 rupees, of course after 2 days I lost everything. I decided not to be interested in the aviator anymore. Then a friend flew in from Delhi, said in Delhi, makes a lot of money on the aviator, but need to test different approaches. We decided to try it together, because he also wanted very much, his friend earns good money, although he does not work anywhere, only aviator.

                First I will show you the stats for the first 2 weeks of work, this was before I met Jay.

                It was a tough 2 weeks, the first days I started earning a little bit, my eyes were burning. But then 3 consecutive negative days, I got frustrated and realized that it was cheating and there was no money to be made. I decided to have a rest on the 21st and 22nd. Do you know how much I made in the end? 2,275 rupees a month. I decided to stop working with aviator because I could not spend so much time and earn Rs 2275 in 2 weeks. A friend had a similar situation, he earned a little more, about 5,000 rupees, but it's still ridiculous.

                By chance we came across Jay's bot on instagram, told about our experience that we earned about 7000 rupees in 2 weeks, Jay laughed and said that in a day 7000 rupees is ok, but in 2 weeks is a bad result. In the next 2 weeks we earned 149500 rupees. It was just a shock to me. I really liked it as I realized that you can earn from anywhere in the world, just need a phone. Look what statistics came out at the end:

                With Jay we were confident, and began to increase costs immediately, because the profit was also increasing. My friend ended up earning more than 200,000 rupees. He didn't keep statistics, but I always like reporting. My net earnings for 2 weeks came out: 149500. I was supposed to transfer 10% to Jay according to the original terms, but I was so happy he helped me earn that I sent him 30000 rupees as a thank you. Next month I have a goal of 300,000. I won't show you the new stats yet, but I will say that I have completed 30% already for the first 5 days of my reporting month.

                In conclusion I want to say that there are always minuses. You do not have to pay much attention to it. It's always a cost in business in the beginning. Aviator should be a business for you. Why aren't you successful at aviator? You gave it up quickly, my friend.
